This is my [Lunarvim](https://www.lunarvim.org/)-inspired config for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).

## Installation

Follow the LazyVim Installation instructions, but clone this repo instead of
the LazyVim starter repo.

```sh
mv $HOME/.config/nvim/ $HOME/.config/nvim.bak
```

```sh
git clone git@github.com:tnthi115/lazyvim.git $HOME/.config/nvim
```
